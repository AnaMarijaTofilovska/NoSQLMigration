# NoSQLMigration
This repository contains a Python script (migration.py) for migrating data from a relational database (SQL Server) to a NoSQL database (MongoDB) for a university enrollment system. The script retrieves data from tables in the SQL database and inserts it into corresponding collections in the MongoDB database.
